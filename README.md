# Air-Passenger-Forecasting---Kaggle

In this Project, data from the International Airline Passengers between the year 1949 to 1960 has been used to predict passengers travelling per month post 1960. The analysis is based on a time series dataset of 12 years. From the visualization, I identified that the dataset has an upward trend and seasonality with lesser number of passengers travelling during the first and second quarter and more air passengers travelling during the third and fourth quarter of each year. Also, the data is highly auto correlated, as the autocorrelation coefficient in all 12 lags are significant.

Regression-based models, advanced exponential smoothing models and autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA) were utilized for this project. Additional variations of the regression and advanced exponential smoothing models were also constructed to ensure good results. The regression models were enhanced, where appropriate, with an autoregressive model for residuals. The same enhancements were made for the advanced exponential smoothing models, where appropriate. Model evaluation was based on the RMSE and MAPE accuracy metrics. The best model to use was Auto ARIMA for the entire data.
